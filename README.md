# collatz_complexity

This code computes the complexity going from 1 to n in the Collatz tree.

I define collatz complexity as the number of times we use the 3k + 1 rule in the collatz tree going from n to 1.

Similarly, I define ztalloc complexity as the number of branch points, or nodes, where there are two possible parents to a vertex in the collatz tree going from 1 up to n.
